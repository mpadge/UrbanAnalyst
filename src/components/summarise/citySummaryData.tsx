<p>The following aspects of paired variables are notably good in comparison to the average of all UA cities:</p><ul>
<li> Moderate strength of relationship between bicycle infrastructure and parking index </li>
<li> Slight strength of relationship between distance to nearest school and accessibility to natural spaces </li>
<li> Slight strength of relationship between transport and bicycle infrastructure </li>
</ul>
<p>While the following aspects are notably bad:</p><ul>
<li> Highly significant and detrimental strength of relationship between bicycle infrastructure and accessibility to natural spaces </li>
</ul>
<h2>Target city for Philadelphia </h2>
<p>The best target city is the city which is best in all the ways that Philadelphia is worse than average. The target city is identified as the city lying at the farthest distance from Philadelphia in the multi-dimensional space of all variables for which Philadelphia is worse than average.</p>
<h2>Best target city is London</h2>
<p> London is better than Philadelphia primarily because of improvements in single variables rather than relationships between variables .</p>
<h2>Single variables</h2>
<h3>Transportation:</h3><ul>
<li>The transport system in London is on average 18% better than in Philadelphia</li>
</ul>
<ul><li>This is particularly influenced by intervals between transport services which are 45% shorter</li></ul>
<h3>Non-Transportation Variables:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Access to natural spaces are 8.4% better than in Philadelphia.</li>
<li>Bicycle infrastructure are 3.6% better than in Philadelphia.</li>
<li>Population density are 1.5% lower than in Philadelphia.</li>
<li>Distances to nearest schools are 41.0% better than in Philadelphia.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Paired variables</h2>
<p>The following aspects of paired variables are notably better in London:</p><ul>
<li> Very notably better strength of relationship between bicycle infrastructure and accessibility to natural spaces </li>
<li> Marginally better strength of relationship between transport and accessibility to natural spaces </li>
<li> Slightly better strength of relationship between population density and parking index </li>
<li> Slightly better strength of relationship between transport and social index </li>
</ul>
<p>While the following aspects are notably worse:</p><ul>
<li> Notably worse strength of relationship between index of access to natural spaces and parking index </li>
<li> Notably worse strength of relationship between bicycle infrastructure and social index </li>
<li> Slightly worse strength of relationship between population density and distances to nearest schools </li>

<h1>Statistical summary of Washington</h1>
<div className={styles.introPara}> <p>This in an automatically-generated summary of the properties of UA variables for Washington based on comparison with data for all other UA cities. The summary includes initial descriptions of &quot;single&quot; and &quot;paired&quot; variables, describing only those for which statistical properties are notably different from average properties for all other cities. This is followed by a section summarising the best &quot;target city&quot; for Washington , selected as the city with the best combined properties for all aspects for which Washington is worse than average.</p></div>

<li> Slightly shorter intervals between transport services </li>
</ul>
<h3>Non-transport variables:</h3>

<p>The following aspects are notably bad in comparison to the average of all UA cities:</p><ul>
<li> Marginally longer distances to nearest schools </li>
