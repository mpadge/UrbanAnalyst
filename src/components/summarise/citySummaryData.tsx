            <h3>Transportation:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Utrecht has the  best transport system of all cities.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This is particularly influenced by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Very notably faster absolute transport times </li>
                <li> Moderately faster relative transport times </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Neverthelss, Utrecht also has:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Very notably more numbers of transfers </li>
                <li> Very notably longer intervals between transport services </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Non-transport variables:</h3>

            <p>The following aspects of individual variables are notably good in comparison to the average of all UA cities:</p><ul>
                <li> Very significantly better bicycle infrastructure </li>
                <li> Very significantly better access to natural spaces </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Paired variables</h2>

            <p>The following aspects of paired variables are notably good in comparison to the average of all UA cities:</p><ul>
                <li> Highly significant strength of relationship between bicycle infrastructure and accessibility to natural spaces </li>
                <li> Highly significant strength of relationship between population density and distances to nearest schools </li>
                <li> Highly significant strength of relationship between transport and social index </li>
                <li> Extremely strong strength of relationship between distance to nearest school and accessibility to natural spaces </li>
                <li> Extremely strong strength of relationship between access to natural spaces and parking index </li>
                <li> Pronounced strength of relationship between bicycle infrastructure and parking index </li>
                <li> Slight strength of relationship between transport and distances to nearest schools </li>
            </ul>
            <p>While the following aspects are notably bad:</p><ul>
                <li> Very pronounced and disadvantageous strength of relationship between population density and accessibility to natural spaces </li>
                <li> Extremely strong and disadvantageous strength of relationship between bicycle infrastructure and social index </li>
                <li> Extremely strong and counterproductive strength of relationship between transport and accessibility to natural spaces </li>

            <h2>Target city for Utrecht </h2>
            <p>The best target city is the city which is best in all the ways that Utrecht is worse than average. The target city is identified as the city lying at the farthest distance from Utrecht in the multi-dimensional space of all variables for which Utrecht is worse than average.</p>
            <h2>Best target city is Muenster</h2>
            <p> Muenster is better than Utrecht primarily because of improvements in relationships between variables rather than single variables .</p>
            <h2>Paired variables</h2>
            <p>The following aspects of paired variables are notably better in Muenster:</p><ul>
                <li> Notably better strength of relationship between transport and accessibility to natural spaces </li>
                <li> Moderately better strength of relationship between transport and bicycle infrastructure </li>
                <li> Slightly better strength of relationship between access to natural spaces and social index </li>
                <li> Marginally better strength of relationship between population density and parking index </li>

                <li> Highly significantly worse strength of relationship between population density and accessibility to natural spaces </li>
