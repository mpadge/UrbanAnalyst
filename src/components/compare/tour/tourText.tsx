            &nbsp;The first controls select which layer or layers to
            compare.  Details on each layer can be seen by clicking on the
            <q>Explain layer</q> button.
            <br />
            <br />
            Layers can also be viewed in <q>Single</q> or <q>Paired</q>
            mode. Single mode displays values for the single selected layer.
            Paired mode displays the strength of relationship between two
            chosen layers.  For example, selecting <q>Social</q> and
            <q>Bicycle Index</q> will display how strongly social
            disavantage is related to bicycle infrastrcuture. Details of
            each selection can always be seen by clicking the <q>Explain
                layer</q> button.
            <br />
            <br />
            Lower values are always better for single layers; interpreations
            of lower vs. higher values for paired layers are always given in
            the <q>Explain layer</q> text.

            values vary within each city (measured as the standard deviation).
