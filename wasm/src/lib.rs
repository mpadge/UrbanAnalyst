/// This is the main function, which reads data from two JSON files, calculates absolute and
/// relative differences between the two sets of data, and writes the results to an output file.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `fname1` - Path to local JSON file with data which are to be mutated.
/// * `fname2` - Path to local JSON file with data of mutation target towards which first data are
/// to be mutated.
/// * `varname` - Name of variable in both `fname1` and `fname2` to be mutated.
/// * `varextra` - Extra variables to be considered in the mutation.
/// * `nentries` - The number of entries to be read from the JSON files.
///
/// # Process
///
/// 1. Reads the variable specified by `varname` from the files `fname1` and `fname2`.
/// 2. Calculates the absolute and relative differences between the two sets of data.
/// 3. Orders the relative differences in descending order.
///
/// The following seven vectors of equal length are written to the output file:
/// 1. values: The original values of 'varname' from 'fname1'.
/// 2. dists: The relative degree by which each should be mutated.
///
/// # Panics
///
/// This function will panic if the input files cannot be read, or if the output file cannot be written.
